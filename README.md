# Masters-Degree-Vision-Transformer-for-Planting-Failure
My biggest project, developed for my Master's research. This implements an Image Classification solution using a cutting-edge Vision Transformer (ViT) model, fine-tuned for an agricultural dataset (classifying between Plant, Soil, and Straw). The solution leverages Transfer Learning to achieve high classification performance.
